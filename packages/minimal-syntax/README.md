# Minimal

I've attempted to consistently limit myself to three primary colors to style similar semantic elements across languages, while remaining easy on the eyes.

- <span style='color:#e10'>**Red**</span>: is used for `constants` and `numeric values`
- <span style='color:#090'>**Green**</span>: is used for `strings` and `attributes`
- <span style='color:#00f'>**Blue**</span>: is used for `language` elements

Different shades and subtle color variants are used to create a visual hierarchy that's quick to read, and easy to understand.

This theme is still a _work in progress_ though **actively maintained**. Suggestions are always welcome and highly appreciated.

### From personal experience

I've created this theme for myself and from personal experience. It is/will be optimised for the languages I regularly use: `html`, `php`, `coffeescript`, `javascript`, `scss`, `css`, `less`, `mysql`, `apache` and `markdown`.
