# TODO

- [x] Move languages to separate files
- [ ] Move these to Issues
- [ ] Get the wrong version of the theme removed
- [ ] `css`: Display prefixed attributes as punctuation
- [ ] `html`: separate different kinds of tags; block, inline, deprecated
- [ ] `php`: The closing double quote of an empty string is not green
- [ ] `less`: make functions in attribute-values bold

<!-- ## atom / interface -->

## css, scss, less

- `less-functions` can't be directly targeted, because they are not defined in their grammar
- `&:nth-child(3)`: the 3 can't be directly targeted

<!-- ## javascript -->

<!-- ## mysql -->

<!-- ## php -->
